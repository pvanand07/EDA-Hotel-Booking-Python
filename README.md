- Improve the online booking process and customer support to increase customer satisfaction.

- Offer popular amenities and services, such as breakfast in bed, more often or as a package deal to increase revenue and customer satisfaction.

- Focus on attracting customers with shorter stays, as they generate higher ADR.

- Allocate resources based on average stay duration, which is relatively higher from June to September.

- Encourage customers to make a deposit by offering additional incentives and reduced rates, to reduce cancellation rates.

- Direct marketing efforts towards online and social media channels to capture more bookings.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the analysis of hotel booking data can provide valuable insights into booking patterns and customer behavior, which can inform strategies to increase occupancy, revenue, and customer satisfaction.
